- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clbmnn, a physics student (first semester) at FAU in Bavaria, Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning basic programming skills, mostly for data evaluation and small personal projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in Java and Python through university classes. I'm looking forward to doing a few beginner projects as soon as I have more free time.

As of now, I'm planning on using GitHub as a tool to track my progression.
